# Image Quality Linear Regression Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building an optimal linear regression model on image quality based on a dataset comprised of 100 samples obtained from surveys completed by volunteers. The surveys capture various characteristics of the images, with the following variables:

1. **Dependent Variable:** `y ImageQuality` – Perceived image quality.
2. **Independent Variables (Regressors):**
   - `x1 ISO` – ISO (sensor sensitivity)
   - `x2 FRatio` – Focal Ratio
   - `x3 Time` – Exposure Time
   - `x4 MP` – Megapixels of the sensor
   - `x5 CROP` – Crop Factor
   - `x6 FOCAL` – Focal Length
   - `x7 PixDensity` – Pixel Density

The values of the various regressors are standardized for consistency.
